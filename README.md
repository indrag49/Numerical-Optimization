# Book Description

This is an open-source introductory book on numerical/mathematical optimization aimed at audience who want to start with the subject matter with hands on implementation of the methods with *Python*. I plan to make this an open source collaborative project which will grow with time with legitimate contributions from the comnmunity.


This book aims to cover the following:

- Introduction to Numerical Optimization
- Introduction to Unconstrained Optimization
- Solving one dimensional optimization problems
- Line Search Descent Method
- Conjugate Gradient Methods
- Quasi-Newton Methods
